/**
 * Packs every package, installs the tarballs the way a consumer does, and
 * imports every subpath each one declares.
 *
 * This exists because `bun run build` exiting 0 proves almost nothing here.
 * The specs import each sibling's source, so nothing they run loads `dist/`.
 * In nxgt-core, where this script comes from, three defects shipped past a
 * green build, each throwing the instant its package was imported, and all
 * three invisible to `bun run build`, `bun typecheck` and `biome`.
 * Only importing the built artifact catches that class of failure. A bin is
 * the same story, so each one declared is run from `node_modules/.bin` with
 * `--help`: that proves the link, the `#!` line and the mode together.
 *
 * The install uses `overrides` so the packages resolve to each other's
 * tarballs rather than to whatever is on the registry — otherwise this would
 * silently verify the *published* versions instead of the working tree.
 * Everything else resolves from the registry the way a consumer's install
 * does. Optional peers are installed too, the way a
 * consumer who uses the subpath that needs one would.
 *
 * A package's `test/declarations/*.ts` is compiled with the declaration
 * build on, against the install: a type a consumer's `.d.ts` must name and
 * the entry does not export fails there with TS2883, and nowhere else.
 *
 * Every built import must name something the manifest declares: the
 * install holds every sibling, so an undeclared one would load here and
 * fail for a consumer.
 *
 * Every package a built `.d.ts` imports must resolve types for a consumer:
 * its own, or an `@types` package it declares where a consumer installs it.
 *
 * Each check lives in `scripts/artifacts/`, one module per responsibility;
 * this file only runs them in order and stops at the first that fails.
